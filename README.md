# EnrollApp-Backend

This is a .Net core Sample API using the Onion Architecture app pattern. The main functionality of this repository
is to generate Subjects, enroll students, and set teachers, on it. This is made for educational purposes.

This repository contains a controller which is dealing with Subjects. You can GET/POST/PUT/PATCH and DELETE them.

I hope this helps. I'm sorry if this contains some initiation problems. This was part of Alkemy's Challenge I was solving for 
hobbies, but I couldn't completely end it for lack of time between college and work.

## How to initialize the project?

If you're using some online ide such as Codespaces; Azure and Aws cloud9, you don't need to install further dependencies.
However, if you're using your local desktop, you must install docker using the package manager whatever the OS you are 
using to. Then run the following command: <pre>docker compose up --build</pre>
